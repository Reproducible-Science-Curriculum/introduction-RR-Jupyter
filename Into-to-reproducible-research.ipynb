    "### Learning objectives for this workshop:\n",
    "1. Understand the concept, importance, and components of reproducible research.\n",
    "1. Describe the architecture of a `Jupyter notebook` environment, including the notebook server, programming language kernels, interactive widgets, and situate `Jupyter notebooks` as part of the wider `Jupyter` ecosystem.\n",
    "1. Use a `Jupyter notebook` to create, manage and report on the execution of a programmatic workflow using a structured document combining narrative text, executable code, executed code output and embedded media items.\n",
    "1. Be able to access the wider `Jupyter` community, including but not limited to the `Jupyter` [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/jupyter), [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) and communities around specific `Python` packages\n",

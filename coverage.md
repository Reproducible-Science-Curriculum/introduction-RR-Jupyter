- Understand the concept, importance, and components of reproducible research
  - Define reproducible research
  - Name four ways that reproducible research practices can help you in your own work.
  - Name & describe the four facets of reproducible research
  - Explain advantages of using Jupyter Notebooks/Python for implementing reproducible practices
- Be able to describe the architecture/components of a Jupyter notebook service/application/environment
  - Describe components of the wider Jupyter ecosystem (draw a diagram?)
    - Other Languages that interface with Jupyter
    - Extending notebooks
      - IPyWidgets: Interactive components within the notebook
      - Outputs: Slides, PDFs, html format
    - Alternative User Interfaces: (API Manager, Dashboard Server → https://github.com/jupyter-incubator )
  - Identify and describe the components of a Jupyter notebook service: web interface, ipynb/JSON notebook format, programming language kernel, Jupyter server
- Be able to use a single Jupyter notebook effectively
  - Access a Jupyter notebook environment
Either: install a Jupyter environment from scratch
Or: access an online Jupyter notebook environment
  - Manage a running Jupyter notebook server application (/tree page): notebook listing, running kernels, terminal
  - Use the browser interface interface to an individual Jupyter notebook effectively:
    - Understand the functions notebook tabs (File, Edit, View, Insert, Cell, Kernel, Help)
    - Execute and modify cells:
      - Insert & delete cells
      - Change cell type (& know different cell types)
      - Run a single cell from taskbar & keyboard shortcut (shift + Enter)
      - Run multiples cells, all cells
      - Re-order cells
      - Split & merge cells
      - Stop a running cell
    - Use Jupyter notebook keyboard shortcuts effectively:
Shift + Enter → run a cell
    - Kernel management
Clear and restart a kernel
Know which kernel you are running on
  - Use a Jupyter notebook to create a document that combines text, code and executed code output:
    - Use Markdown cells to:
generate rich text, demonstrating: headings, lists, embedded images, code formatting
embed media objects: images, video, audio
    - Use code cells to:
      - execute code fragments
      - create rich outputs: tables, images
      - perform command line operations: use the ! operator
      - display documentation and help files: use the ? operator
      - list variables, functions, and modules in your notebook (%whos)
- Be able to access the wider Jupyter community
  - Identify 2+ resources (online or a local group) you can use/ask questions as you learn & develop your Python research project. 
    - Jupyter Google Group
    - GitHub repo, gitter etc?

# introduction-RR-Jupyter
Introduction materials for Reproducible Research Curriculum with `Jupyter Notebook` and `Python`.

The individual segments of this lesson are contained in `.ipynb` files, located in the notebooks folder. These notebook lessons are designed to be taught in the following order:
- [Intro to and motivation for reproducibile research](https://github.com/Reproducible-Science-Curriculum/introduction-RR-Jupyter/blob/gh-pages/notebooks/Intro-to-reproducible-research.ipynb)
- [Intro to Jupyter Notebooks](https://github.com/Reproducible-Science-Curriculum/introduction-RR-Jupyter/blob/gh-pages/notebooks/Jupyter_Intro_Background.ipynb) - [slides generated from notebook](https://reproducible-science-curriculum.github.io/introduction-RR-Jupyter/docs/slides/Jupyter_Intro_Background.slides.html#/)
- [Navigating the Notebook](https://github.com/Reproducible-Science-Curriculum/introduction-RR-Jupyter/blob/gh-pages/notebooks/Navigating%20the%20notebook%20-%20instructor%20script.ipynb): These are notes to the instructor to get students up and running with Jupyter. Here students can start a diary notebook to take notes throughout the workshop.
